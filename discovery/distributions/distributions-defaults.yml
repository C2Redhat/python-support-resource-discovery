# This file specifies the defaults that distributions will utilize.
defaults:
  # The default distribution to use.
  # Note that for Fedora the minor version is not used.
  #
  # If the specified version is earlier than the minimum version specified in
  # the matching OS family or is otherwise unavailable ((based on web search)
  # distributions will utilize the most recent available family version.  If no
  # such version is available (again, based on web search) distributions will
  # utilize the most recent available Fedora version at least as recent as the
  # Fedora minimum.
  #
  # Due to current requirements that the bunsen infrastructure machine may be
  # required to function as an iscsi server and the default distribution is
  # used for the infrastructure machine this must be specified as Fedora 30.
  # It is the only currently tested distribution for which the bunsen
  # configuration of an iscsi server is verified to work.
  distribution:
    family: fedora
    major: 30
    minor:

  # The "minimum" in each OS family specifies the earliest version of the OS
  # family that is supported.  Note that for Fedora there is no minor version.

  # CentOS/RHEL defaults
  # "specialRepos" are used to specify repositories for packages that are not
  # provided by the distributions but are required for development/testing.
  # The first level labels under "specialRepos" are treated as regular
  # expressions simplifying the processing code's disambiguation of
  # distributions with common prefixes; e.g., fedora32 and fedora320.
